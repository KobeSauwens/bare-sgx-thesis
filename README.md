# Minimal SGX enclave development on bare-metal Linux platforms 

**Coming soon!**

This repository is intended to host a minimal, fully customizable framework and
example use cases for developing bare-metal SGX enclaves in assembly and C by
directly interfacing with the SGX driver in the Linux kernel, without the
complexity and overhead of existing external SDKs.

This project originated from a
[discussion](https://lore.kernel.org/all/da0cfb1e-e347-f7f2-ac72-aec0ee0d867d@intel.com/)
on the Linux kernel mailing list and the initial code will be forked from the
existing
[selftests/sgx](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/tree/master/tools/testing/selftests/sgx)
enclave in the Linux repository.
